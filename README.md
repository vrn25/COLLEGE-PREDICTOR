# College Predictor

## College Predictor is a Web Application to match the students to their appropriate college based on their ranks.

### This project was done under [IEEE NITK ENVISION 2018](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/#events). It uses following tools and technologies:
* **Client-side**: The UI/UX of the application is created using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **JQuery** and **Bootstrap**. 

* **Server-side**: It uses python-based framework **Django** for back-end.

* The project uses a modified version of [**Gale-Shapely Algorithm**](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf) in python for matching the students to colleges.
